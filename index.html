<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>RuneLibris is a wiki database created and maintained by the RuneScape Preservation Unit that documents RuneScape's history. Its current focus is on archiving to non-repeatable server interactions that existed for a significant amount of time in RS2, RSHD and RS3, as to prevent the game from becoming lost media in the future.</p>
<p>Interactions are primarily recorded in .webp and .webm format. A programming-like approach and advanced MediaWiki functions are used to try to document as much as possible.</p>
<p>This website is a read-only preview of RuneLibris. Some features may not work. The full version of this database is distributed as a 5 GB .vhd file that contains a pre-installed version of XAMPP that runs a local MediaWiki installation (<a href="preview.png">wiki screenshot</a>). Furthermore, it includes a variety of datasets that are excluded from this demonstration version.</p>
<p>The feature-complete version of this wiki can be downloaded <a href="https://mega.nz/folder/hoZRkQ5D#9nUYgVrKUD50tqKPsrmXCg">here</a>. It is designed to work on Windows 7 and above, though one might be able to get it working on other operating systems by substituting XAMPP for something else. RuneLibris is provided as-is with no guarantee of support.</p>
