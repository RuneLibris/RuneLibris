                <h1>RuneLibris Devlog #6</h1>
                <p>On 03 May 2025 I launched this GitHub website as to make the archives of RuneLibris more accessible. As I don't have the knowledge to host the actual MediaWiki installation, I figured that the next best thing to do was to generate static web pages. I downloaded HTML files using wget and then mass-modified files using grepWin.</p>
                <p>This whole process was quite the ordeal. That being said, I found it surprising how easy GitHub and GitHub Desktop are to use. I expect way more trouble on that front.</p>
                <p>I am aware that the RuneLibris demonstration (this website) still has some problems. For example, every page with ":" in its name cannot be clicked on. Fixing this will be my next priority next week.</p>
                <p>This week, I standardized my sleep schedule, allowing me to optimize how many hours I am awake per day. This resulted in me gaining lot of time despite being relatively busy IRL.</p>
                <p>The main thing I did this week was finishing transcribing data from my 2021 music map videos. I also made the music unlock hint page, which document the history of that function thorough the game's history.</p>
                <p>My main focus is still on music. I intent to try to map out most of the RuneScape 3' RuneScape Surface music map in the coming days. Once that is out of the way, I will be able to start archiving quests that were removed and altered.</p>
