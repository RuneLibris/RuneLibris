                <h1>RuneLibris Devlog #5</h1>
                <p>This week, I started working on listing the aspects of RuneScape. I opted to make a table on the front page; this is to ensure that some aspects of the game will have a matching validation table link (when applicable). This will ensure that X aspect of the game will be archived for Y period of the game for fill-in data (i.e location examines). This will also allow us to index which historical data is missing.</p>
                <p>Related to the aforementioned system, key RuneScape builds (revisions) now have their own pages. My initial idea was to parse key data for every year in the game, but now I am getting concerned that such a process would be too ambitious. Regardless, I still think that the infrastructure to do this should be there, so I left this system as is.</p>
                <p>I also started parsing some videos I recorded back in 2021 to gather music unlock data. This process might be more complicated than I first thought as some mapsquares have no obvious music unlocks. Some tracks can also unlock in multiple areas. For example, Harmony can be unlocked either south of Falador or in Lumbridge. I will need to find a way to deal with this.</p>
                <p>I must admit that I haven't done much this week. I sadly had other priorities in real life. I have revised how I approach my day-to-day planning as to make more time for RuneLibris.</p>
