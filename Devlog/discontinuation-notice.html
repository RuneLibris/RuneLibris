                <h1>Discontinuation Notice</h1>
                <p>As you may have noticed, there was not any activity on RuneLibris since 14 June 2025. This because I lost interest in this project. RuneScape is a game too complex to archive. I had tried to account for this by limiting the scope of the project, but that didn't work.</p>
                <p>As such, I have decided to move on from any RuneScape Preservation activities. I will focus my attention on other projects I can actually finish.</p>
                <p>The final version of RuneLibris will be uploaded on <a href="https://archive.org/details/runelibris">this Internet Archive page</a> (the final version will have the filename "RuneLibris (2025).vhd"). The file will be uploaded at some point before 31 December 2025.</p>
                <p>For any future inquiry, I refer you to <a href="https://manpaint.neocities.org/">my personal blog</a> for more information.</p>
