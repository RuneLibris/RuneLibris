                <h1>RuneLibris Devlog #10</h1>
                <p>While working on RuneLibris those last weeks, it dawned on me that the infrastructure of the wiki was a mess. Things were defined at multiple places and there was room for lots of streamlined. As such, infrastructure work was my main focus this week.</p>
                <p>I implemented a new task system on the wiki. A task is something that takes a considerable amount of time to do (i.e archiving a quest). This is in contrast to the todo template that is used to mark missing data or information, or in other words, a "sub-task". This new system also account for the possibility of a piece of content having interactions that differ greatly from the rest.</p>
                <p>One of the things I realized was that RuneLibris was missing a way to tell which content is not archived. As such, I imported an exhaustive list of quests and minigames. Each entry using the aforementioned task template. I also created the requirement index metric to measure how inaccessible a piece of content is.</p>
                <p>Another problem I tackled is how RuneScape has lots of subjects. For example, there is 44540 in build 900. Creating a page or template for all of these would be pure insanity. I realized that when it comes to archiving those kinds of things, I only seek to archive its attributes (i.e item examines, item weights). As such, I have decided that attributes will be considered a meta aspect of sorts and that data will be validated using the python replacement script. This new system also solves a logic error where the wiki structure would have considered "Items examines" to be an item in itself, which it is obviously not.</p>
                <p>An attempt was made to rework the aspect list found into the front page into a dynamic table, like the one used to document quest interactions. Although I was technically successful, I decided to stick to a bog standard wikitable as it is more readable. My motive was to add dynamic entries that would remind me to document data for a given build, but I realized that I can simply use a validation table to do that.</p>
                <p>The tools required to generate the live preview from the VHD are now bundled with it. I must admit that not including them earlier was a bit of an oversight on my part.</p>
                <p>I also started working on a quest requirement system as to enumerate all the requirements for  a given quest and all its requirement as the equivalent system on RuneScape Wiki only list requirements for immediate quests.</p>
                <p>Speaking of quests, I also started working on Doric's Quest.Reorganizing the wiki made me realize that I have the habit of starting lots of tasks without finish them. This is something I will try to correct.</p>
                <p>Despite me starting this iteration of RuneLibris on 28 March 2025, only 1 quest has been archived so far. I find this lack of progress utterly unacceptable one my part and I will do everything in my power to course-correct.</p>
