                <h1>RuneLibris Devlog #8</h1>
                <p>So this week, I continued working on archiving the 2018 version of Tutorial Island. I quickly realized doing this would take ages. There were two main problems: every subject had their own pages and said pages needed me to manually import right click actions and examines from the cache and official datasets.</p>
                <p>Inspired by transcripts page on RuneScape Wiki, I decided that every subject for a given piece of content should be on one page. This allows me to have a clearer overview of what exactly is missing in a given quest. Prior to this, I needed to rely on a DPL, which was quite inefficient.</p>
                <p>I also acquired a powerful new replacement script that allows me to pull automatically pull data from a series of datasets when making a content page. This means I no longer have to manually input the actions for a given subject. The datasets I use do have some gaps, but it covers the vast majority of cases, which is good enough for me.</p>
                <p>Each subject is now defined by the new "Content" template. It allows me to perform a variety of automated checks based on the aforementioned automatically imported data.</p>
                <p>As quests now are in a single page, this now means that the number of pages in RuneLibris has massively decreased. This RuneLibris demonstration previously had 302 html files; now there is only 152. </p>
                <p>The new content archival system did introduce some minor problems. The reference section for a page is now very big. Content pages also take a while to "compile" on my end. I will look into issues in the upcoming weeks to see if there is anything I can do.</p>
                <p>In other news, I updated the archive certification template to provide more details about the archival status of a given page.</p>
                <p>I also made a decision regarding RuneLibris updates. As generating this live preview takes a considerable amount of time, I have decided that I will now make monthly updates instead. At the end of each month, I will publish a progress report and will update the online demonstration at the same time.</p>
                <p>As a result of this change, I have decided that the RuneLibris VHD file will be updated on a weekly basis (typically on Sundays) as to ensure that an updated backup of the archive exists online.</p>
