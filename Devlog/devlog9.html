                <h1>RuneLibris Devlog #9</h1>
                <p>This week, I continued working on archiving the 2018 version of Tutorial Island. While documenting interactions, something dawned on me. Subjects that have the most interactions tend to be those that have "human-like traits". For example, a NPCs can say different things depending on the quest state. This is in contrast to "static subjects" that tend to have only a "before", "main" and "after" state.</p>
                <p>One problem I decided to look into was how every page had a metric ton of references. I solved this issue by making a custom reference system using templates. Instead of the standard MediaWiki reference node, a template is now used to mark where an interaction came from.</p>
                <p>I also made changes to the content template - it now takes less screen space. A side effect of this is that pages now take less time to compile. Tutorial Island (2018) used to take 43 seconds, now it only takes 21.</p>
                <p>I eventually grew tired of archiving Tutorial Island, so I switched gears and started documenting the original version of Wolf Whistle.</p>
                <p>As the quest is pretty short, it only took a few days for Wolf Whistle to become the first quest that is fully archived in RuneLibris. Well, the quest does have some lost media, but the archive is as complete as it can be. All the data used to preserve the quest only weights 11.8 Mb. For the record, all the video sources used for that quest weight 716 Mb, a stark difference.</p>
                <p>One thing I did notice is that they were way more videos of Wolf Whistle than there is for Witch's Potion. I theorize it's because the former has been turned into a miniquest fairly early on and thus became less visible as a result.</p>
                <p>In other news, I made the following changes to RuneLibris:</p>
				  <ul>
                <li>Converted verification DPLs into template params</li>
                <li>Added "incomplete" state to certification template</li>
                <li>Improved table styling on live preview</li>
                <li>Documented 468 (Summoning WIP) build</li>
                <li>Wrote an article about Jagex's backups</li>
                <li>Added a marker to todo template</li>
                <li>Added a marker to comment template</li>
                <li>Created lost media template</li>
                <li>Streamlined validation panel</li>
                <li>Added lost media certification variant</li>
                <li>Teaked live preview CSS</li>
                <li>Streamlined demo generation process</li>
                <li>Reworked live preview's main page</li>
                  </ul> 
                <p>On a final note, I have decided that this GitHub website will now be updated as I see fit. It won't follow any kind of schedule anymore. Future updates will likely be based on content archival milestones. It should be noted that I will still update the .vhd file on a weekly basis.</p>
