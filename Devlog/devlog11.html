                <h1>RuneLibris Devlog #11</h1>
                <p>I started this week by creating a page for every aspect targeted by RuneLibris and added related tasks. I also discontinued the old "data pages" system as it is no longer used.</p>
                <p>While archiving examines for OSRS 196-3, I noticed that most of the problem I have with RuneLibris is due to the game having multiple cache formats. In fact, I think that any "framework change" is what causes problems in general. As dealing with problems is very time consuming and then to detract from my main archival goals, I have assigned a specific day of the week to deal with such situations. On the other days, I will continue archiving information as usual (i.e documenting a quest). As a result of this, I reclassified many tasks as being "research".</p>
                <p>I have also decided to take a break my work on RuneLibris. There is a hobby I want to try out that will take most of attention. I expect to resume work on this project at the begging of August 2025 - possibly earlier depending on how things go. During this timeframe, I might occasionally add some information to the wiki, but no significant work will be performed.</p>
                <p>In other news, I made the following changes to RuneLibris:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Added length label to disparate tasks</li>
                <li>Added cache indexes info to cache article</li>
                <li>Wrote an article about floor aspect</li>
                <li>Made a dump of OSRS music pages to archive music coordinates</li>
                <li>Added "locked" state to Template:Task</li>
                <li>Excluded quest beyond 2021-11-23 threshold</li>
                <li>Added "missing quest reqs" validation table</li>
                <li>Added "item in bank" check</li>
                <li>Added "latest mapsquares" validation table</li>
                <li>Added drop param to Template:Content</li>
                <li>Added droptable param to Template:Content</li>
                  </ul>
